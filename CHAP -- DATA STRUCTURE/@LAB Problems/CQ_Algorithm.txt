Definition - A circular queue is one in which the insertion of new element is done at the very first location of the queue when the last location of the queue is full. A circular queue overcomes the problem of unutilized space in linear queue.

-- Algorithm of Insertion

  if(front == (rear+1) % MAXSIZE)
	print "Queue Overflow"
  else
	input the data
	if(front == -1)
		set front = rear = 0
		
	rear = ((rear+1) % MAXSIZE)
    Q[rear] = data
  exit
  
  
-- Algorithm of Deletion

	if(front == -1)
		print "Queue Underflow"
	else
		data = Q[front]
		if(front == rear)
			set front = rear = -1
		else
			front = ((front+1) % MAXSIZE)
	exit
