What is Merge Sort?

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits an array into smaller subarrays, sorts each subarray, and then merges them back together in sorted order.

Key Characteristics:

1. Divide-and-conquer approach
2. Stable sorting algorithm
3. Time complexity: O(n log n)
4. Space complexity: O(n)
5. Suitable for large datasets

How Merge Sort Works:

1. Divide the array into two halves until each subarray has only one element.
2. Recursively sort each subarray.
3. Merge adjacent sorted subarrays into a single sorted subarray.
4. Repeat step 3 until the entire array is sorted.

Merge Sort Steps:

1. Divide
2. Conquer (recursively sort subarrays)
3. Merge (combine sorted subarrays)

Advantages:

1. Efficient sorting algorithm
2. Stable (preserves original order of equal elements)
3. Scalable (suitable for large datasets)
4. Easy to implement

Disadvantages:

1. Requires extra memory for merging
2. Not suitable for real-time sorting

Real-World Applications:

1. Database sorting
2. File system organization
3. Data compression
4. Web search engines

Variations:

1. Top-down Merge Sort
2. Bottom-up Merge Sort
3. Iterative Merge Sort
4. Parallel Merge Sort

Comparison with Other Sorting Algorithms:

1. Quicksort: Merge Sort is more stable and efficient for large datasets.
2. Heapsort: Merge Sort has better time complexity.
3. Bubble Sort: Merge Sort is more efficient and scalable.
